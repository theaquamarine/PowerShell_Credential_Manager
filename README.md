## History

### v2.0
- Implemented pipeline support for Get-StoredCredential.
- Implemented pipeline support for New-StoredCredential.
- Implemented pipeline support for Remove-StoredCredential.
- Improved error handling to respect the Error Action Preference in PowerShell.
- Changed AsPSCredential to a Switch parameter and renamed to AsCredentialObject on Get-StoredCredential to make it easier to use.
- Added Credentials parameter to New-StoredCredential which accepts a PSCredential object instead of User name and Password.
- Added SecuserPassword parameter to New-StoredCredential which accepts a SecureString as the password.
- Credential object now returns LastWritten as a DateTime instead of a ComType.FILETIME
- Changing license to MIT from GPL
- General refactoring and bug fixes. 

### v1.1 Bug Fix
Fixed a bug where the username specified in the -UserName parameter was not being used to create the credential in the store. The username for the logged on user was being used instead. Issue logged https://github.com/davotronic5000/PowerShell_Credential_Manager/issues/8


### v1.0 Initial Release
Implementing basic functionality
- Get-StoredCredential - Gets one or more credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.
- New-Stored Credential - Adds a new credential to the Windows Credential Manager.
